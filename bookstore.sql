However, selecting the right career option is one of the most difficult decisions for a student. Almost all of us go through this dilemma after passing class 12th exams. While some are aware of the courses available and the right approach to go for it to reach their career goals, while others are clueless about the courses or the colleges to take admission in.Today, there are lot many options for class XII pass outs, in which they can pursue their graduation. However, there are no safe careers as such. One will do well in life if they follow their interest. The course one selects for graduation is the stepping stone towards building his/her career, so whatever course one chooses, it must be in accordance to his/her passion. Also, the course one chooses must assure a good scope for career options. Select a field that has chances of growth in the future. Countercheck all the details about the course and its significance in the industry. It happens often that we are misled by the opinions of others and take wrong decisions, so make sure you do not fall prey to any kind of pre-conceived assumptions. College will get over in three years but the course will stay forever. Its also better to get a general undergraduate degree than go for a programme that restricts future options, if ones unsure where ones heart lies. If a student has an interest in more than one course, they should choose the one that has a broader scope. The possibility of doing post-graduation in that subject is then higher, since fewer seats are available at the postgraduate level. Students should always take admission in the first college if he/she gets an opportunity to do so. With every list, the options would increase and with it the liberty to switch colleges and get admission in ones preferred college. When it comes to choosing between a course and a college, the emphasis should be firmly on the first. It doesnt make much of a difference which college a student gets an undergraduate degree from but the course will matter.It is important that students choose a suitable stream in class 12 to ensure that they are able to join a career of their choice after passing the 12th exams. Those with a humanities or arts background can qualify for a variety of creative courses. While choosing a professional or an academic course, students must be sure about their career plans. Courses in fashion design, mass communication, advertising hotel management, performing arts, travel and tourism are some options which offer lucrative career opportunities. Also, foreign language courses are on a high demand.There are a lot of career options for those with a commerce stream. Apart from chartered accountancy, which happens to be the foremost career goal for students, company secretary, BBM, BBA, etc., are some of the courses opted by students at graduation level.There are hundreds of career options for students with science stream. One of the major advantages as to why students take up science is that they can switch to humanities or even commerce later on.Further, outside the ambit of schools and colleges, students can also take up courses in fashion technology, jewellery design, aviation, video jockey, etc. It is important to get into a career of ones choice to enjoy work.This book has information for students who have passed the senior secondary examination (Class XII) or an equivalent examination and wishes to seek admission to various undergraduate courses.
