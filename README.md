### Setup: 

Please follow those instruction to set up your local machine. 

1. Download xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html 
2. Find and open ```php.ini``` in xampp file. For mac : Open your XAMPP application and ```press start``` on the ```general``` tab. After that go into the ```Volumes``` tab, and click ```mount```. Once it is mounted navigate click the ```explore``` button and it will open you the ```lampp``` folder, where all your application/apache related files are located.  
3. Add those lines to the end in your ```php.ini```. 
   - For mac: ```extension=pgsql.so```
   - For windows: ```extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll``` and ```extension=php_pgsql.dll```
5. Pull this repository to your machine and make sure to locate at xampp/htdocs
6. For mac: from the ```lampp``` folder navigate to ```etc``` > ```extra``` > ```httpd-xampp.conf```. Open this file and in the section ```Since xampp 1.4.3``` change the ```Require admin``` to ```Require all granted```
7. Open in your browser ```http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/``` and click ```New``` at the left Navigator to create a new database. (```name= DatabaseName```, ```uft code= utf8_unicode_ci```) <br /> 
8. once ```DatabaseName``` created, navigate to your project location, usually on ```c:\xampp\htdocs\BookStore``` and import ```bookstore.sql```
9. Then ignore the error that shows up After clicking ```Go```. 

### Deployement Script: Running the Web Application

1. Open xampp and go to manage servers and start ```Apache``` and ```MySQL``` web server.
2. Open ```dbconnect.php``` and modify it.
3. To find where is your ```localhost/password```, please follow step
   
  - Step 1:
    - Locate phpMyAdmin installation path.
  - Step 2:
    - Open phpMyAdmin>config.inc.php in your favourite text editor.
  - Step 3:
    - $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'config';
    - $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'root';
    - $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = '';
    - $cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension'] = 'mysqli';
    - $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = true;
    - $cfg['Lang'] = '';
    
4. navigate to http://localhost/BookStore/ and you are all set :D

N.B: if you created a new folder named ```example``` to pull the repository to it, make sure to add the name of the folder in your URL (e.g: http://localhost/example/BookStore/)

## Setting-up the testing environment

Unit tesiting: For the unit testing we used [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (v1.9.3) and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) (v9.0)

### Composer

Installing composer on windows/osx is different and you can find extra information on how to install it here: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
Theses commands will install composer globally on your machine, and can be used by any of your project. 

1. For mac, type in terminal: ```curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php```
2. rename it to composer for ease of use: ```mv composer.phar /usr/local/in/composer```
3. ```composer init```

### PHPUnit

1. ```composer require phpunit/phpunit```

To run the tests in the ```tests``` folder, run ```./vendor/bin/phpunit tests``` from inside your project.
